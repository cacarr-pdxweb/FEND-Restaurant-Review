# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - Project 5 - Restaurant Review App

## Upgrading a dysfunctional restaurant review website 
For this Udacity FEND project, we were provided with a restaurant review website in a rather poor state. Our task was to convert it into a responsive, accessible web application, featuring basic offline access utilizing Service Workers to cache the application shell --developing the initial stage of a so-called Progressive Web App. 

## Running the Application
Clone the application: https://github.com/cacarr-pdxweb/FEND-Restaurant-Review.git

Run a server locally:

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
